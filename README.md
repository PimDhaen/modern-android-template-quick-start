# Modern Android Template Quick Start

*Welcome!* This is a ready-to-use template for starting a fresh Android app with all the latest goodies to help you quickly get started on a scalable and maintainable app üöÄ‚Äç.

*I will try to always keep it up to date (please feel free to contribute)*

## Quick Start

Clone this repository into Android Studio, and click run (here's a friendly reminder to update to the [latest Android Studio version](https://developer.android.com/studio)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pim-developer/modern-android-template-quick-start.git
```

**Tip:** I prefixed everything that needs renaming with *Rename*, if you're not familiar with renaming packages or if it becomes a hassle, here's a guide: [How to rename a package in Android Studio](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16804093/rename-package-in-android-studio).

## Architecture

This template follows the official Google best practises [guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture):

- **Activity Structure:** Single Activity Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Modularization:** 1 Module

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows (seperation of concerns):

- `app/`
    - `src/`
        - `main/`
            - `java/com/renamecompanyname/renameappname`
                - `ui/` - Contains all UI-related stuff; Screens, [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation)
                - `presentation/` - ViewModels for handling UI data
                - `model/` - Data models

### Version Catalog

The project uses a version catalog file, `libs.versions.toml`, to manage all dependencies across the project. This file is a `.toml` format that helps manage dependencies and versions in a scalable, organized, and modern way. Learn more here: [Migrate to Version Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs).
